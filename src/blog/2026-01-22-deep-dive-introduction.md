Our contributor Manuel Kießling has written a comprehensive introduction to SiteBuilder on his blog, covering:

- **The problem**: Why simple content changes often require engineering involvement, and how that creates bottlenecks
- **The approach**: Chat-based editing with Git-backed workflows and PR review
- **Features**: Isolated Docker workspaces, GitHub integration, cost transparency, and more
- **Architecture**: The tech stack (Symfony 7.4, PHP 8.4, TypeScript/Stimulus) and the two-layer workspace isolation model

The post includes a demo video showing SiteBuilder in action.
